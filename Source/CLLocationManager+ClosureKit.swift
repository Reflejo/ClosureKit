CLLocationManager with closure callback.

Note that when using startUpdatingLocation(handler) you need to use the counterpart 
`stopUpdatingLocationHandler` or you'll leak memory.

Example:

```swift
let locationManager = CLLocationManager()
locationManager.starUpdatingLocation { location in
    println("Location: \(location)")
}
locationManager.stopUpdatingLocationHandler()
```

WARNING: You cannot use closures *and* set a delegate at the same time. Setting a delegate will prevent
closures for being called and setting a closure will overwrite the delegate property.
